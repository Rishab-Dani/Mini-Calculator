Description :

This is a simple console-based calculator developed in Java. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as:

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Modulus :

The application takes user input from the command line, performs the selected operation, and displays the result. It includes basic exception handling to prevent errors like division by zero.

How i Built this :

1.Planned the structure of the calculator â€“ identified the required operations.

2.Created methods for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus).

3.Used Scanner class for user input.

4.Implemented a menu-driven interface using switch statements.

5.Handled invalid inputs and division by zero using try-catch and condition checks.
